// Generator: Do not mix generators and futures
// Guard: controls filtering behavior so make sure conditions are correct
// inline-assiGnment: we can have inline assignment but ideally should be avoided
// Give or yield: if possible make sure your for expression returns something
// make use of maps and flatmap rather for expressions
